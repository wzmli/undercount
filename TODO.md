## To do

- more systematic review of the citing papers, see how many of them actually use the method vs. quoting the estimates vs. just citing the method in general?
- check the asymptor package (on CRAN, or https://hugogruson.fr/asymptor/)?
    - redo calculations with COVID/monkeypox data?
    - run asymptor on simulated data?
- follow-up to e-mail: more sims?
   - use asymptor to get upper/lower bounds?
   - plot predicted, true
   - predicted number of hidden cases = lambda*reported cases = a lambda I
   - true hidden cases = (1-a)I
   - a/(1-a) ~ lambda
   - a between 0.1 and 0.7 â†’ odds between 1/9 and 7/3
   - lambda ~ a few % per day?
