## To do

Wordsmith the end of math

We have added a more developed version of the logical argument as suggested. 


* Look up Richards curve shape estimates? e.g. see @chowellUsing2016, @mingioneShortterm in bib file. May have to distinguish between *generalized* Richards (two separate shape parameters for growth-phase dynamics and density-dep component) and our (Ma et al) Richards, which only has one for density-dep

Respond to reviews.  **Deadline**: 26 November 2022

* Add algebra/math description back in.
* Describe sims more ... ???
* Write responses.


- more systematic review of the citing papers, see how many of them actually use the method vs. quoting the estimates vs. just citing the method in general?
	- (DONE)
- include citation info in paper?
- fix workflow, improve README
- streamline paper further?
- plots: TikZ?  smaller points in Fig 2?  Check dt = 7 estimates for weirdness.
