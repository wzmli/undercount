## To do

- more systematic review of the citing papers, see how many of them actually use the method vs. quoting the estimates vs. just citing the method in general?
	- (DONE)
- include citation info in paper?
- fix workflow, improve README
- streamline paper further?
- submit to Medrxiv etc.
- plots: TikZ?  smaller points in Fig 2?  Check dt = 7 estimates for weirdness.
