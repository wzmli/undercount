We are happy that our changes were well-received. We have accepted all of the minor changes suggested by the reviewer. The only changes that require further comment are:


* pg 3/l 23 "The estimated upper bound ..." The reviewer said "Could we say that the method implicitly assumes a constant ascertainment ratio?" We are not quite sure what this comment means. In this simplified case we have assumed a constant ascertainment ratio for convenience, and have added a clarifying note.
* eq 1: we now define all of the parameters immediately after the equation - this is not "before being used", but is a standard and easily understandable convention
