We are happy that our changes were well-received. We have accepted all of the minor changes suggested by the reviewer. A few further coments below

**Could we say that the method implicitely assume a constant ascertainment ratio?**

We are not quite sure what this comment means. In this simplified case we have assumed a constant ascertainment ratio for convenience. We have added a clarifying note about this.

**quantities in the formula should be defined before being used**

We now define all of the parameters either before use or immediately after their mention (for eq 1).
