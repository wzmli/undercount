<<<<<<< Updated upstream
We are happy that our changes were well-received. We have accepted all of the minor changes suggested by the reviewer. The only changes that require further comment are:


* pg 3/l 23 "The estimated upper bound ..." The reviewer said "Could we say that the method implicitly assumes a constant ascertainment ratio?" We are not quite sure what this comment means. In this simplified case we have assumed a constant ascertainment ratio for convenience, and have added a clarifying note.
* eq 1: we now define all of the parameters immediately after the equation - this is not "before being used", but is a standard and easily understandable convention
=======
Thanks to the editors and reviewers for valuable comments.

We have address the suggestions from reviewer 2.



## Reviewer 2

**I would say "In our opinion, such..." or "We show that such..."**

Done

**Based on such simulation results and corroborated by analytic proofs, we show that...**

Done

**Your argument is clear; however, even if the approach could be used, and time occasions be used as sampling occasions, we would need to know how many of the incident cases at (t-1) are still cases at t. That is, we would need to know incidence, removal, death, and migration rates, which is usually not the case for public health registries**

It will require more information such as the infectious period (i.e. how many of the incident cases at (t-x) are still cases at t) and etc. 

**Could we say that the method implicitely assume a constant ascertainment ratio?**

The ascertainment ratio is dependent on $\lambda$ as described and shown in the algebra.

**quantities in the formula should be defined before being used**

Please fill in h.
