We are happy that our changes were well-received. We have accepted all of the minor changes suggested by the reviewer. Our only specific responses to the reviewer's comments are:

**Could we say that the method implicitely assume a constant ascertainment ratio?**

Our analysis _explicitly_ assumes a constant ascertainment ratio for convenience. We have clarified this in the MS.

**quantities in the formula should be defined before being used**

We now define all of the parameters either before use or (for eq 1) immediately after their mention.
